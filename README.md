Projects I've worked on in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL

Update  on 9/16/24

I wanted to learn Python and decided to do my first project. I felt ready as I have been learning the basics of coding and python syntax. Granted, this was from guided instruction on [Datacamp's Wordcloud Tutorial]([url](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/wordcloud-python)). This took me about 7 days, for about an 1-2 hours each day. Although this was an online code along, not all of the code fit neatly into my coding environment (Visual Studio). I had to figure out some workarounds, and pretty much why many times, each line of code failed. At the end, I ended up creating something I am proud of and have learned a lot. I would say learning by doing is the best way to learn.
